Building EC2 Hosts with Python Boto3 and Pyrax

This is my home grown Cloud provisioner.  I had to build standardised environments in both Rackspace and AWS so cloudformation was not an option.
Of course now I use Terraform so a large use case of this is now defunct.  However, for building ad-hoc instances it can still be useful.
